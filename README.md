# Credit_score_classfctn
The Credit Card Classification Project is a machine learning project focused on classifying credit card transactions into different categories. This system is designed to help financial institutions, businesses, or individuals identify and categorize credit card transactions accurately.

# More about Credit Score with ML
The project is implemented in a Jupyter Notebook, using the Python programming language and several popular machine learning libraries such as NumPy, Pandas, Matplotlib, and Seaborn. The data used in this project is a simulated dataset of individuals and their credit scores, which I use to train and evaluate several different machine learning models.

# Flow for my evaluation:
1. Load dataset
2. Data preprocessing
3. Model selection
4. Model Training
5. Model evaluation

# Prerequisites
- Python installed (version X.X.X)

 # Model Training and Evaluation
 As yoy see my jupyter file, and the whole dataset what we can conclude is:
 From the 15 box plots, we can deduce the following:
1.The more someone earns anually, the better their credit score is.
2.Similar to annual income, a higher monthly in-hand salary leads to a better credit score.
3.The ideal number of bank accounts is 2 - 4. Having more than 5 negatively affects your credit score.
4.Similar to bank accounts, having more than 5 credit cards will negatively affect your credit scores. The ideal number is 3-5.
5.4 - 11% is the sweet spot for average instest rate. Anything above 15% is a no-no.
6.Take 1-3 loans at a time inorder to keep a good credit score. Having more than 3 loans negatively impacts credtit scores.
7.To maintain a good credit score, you have a 5-14 day delay window. Delaying for more than 17 days affects your credit score negatively.
8.Delaying 4-12 payments from the due date is the safety window. Anything above 12 payments negatively affexts credit scores.
9.An outstanding debt of 380–1150 will not affect your credit scores, but going above $1338 affects your credit scores negatively.
10.Your credit utilization ratio doesn’t affect your credit scores.
11.Having a long credit history results in better credit scores.
12.The number of EMIs you are paying in a month doesn’t affect credit scores that much.
13.How much you invest monthly doesn’t really affect your credit scores.
14.Having a high monthly balance in your account at the end of the month is good for your credit scores.
15.Credit scores tend to improve with an increase in age.

A credit mix refers to the multiple types of loan accounts you hold, such as credit cards, student loans, mortgages, and car loans

Thank you for your interest in this project. I hope you find it informative.
